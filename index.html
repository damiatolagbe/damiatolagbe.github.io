    <h1>Let Us Stop Deforestation</h1>
    <h2>Overview </h2>
    <p> Deforestation is the purposeful clearing of forested land. The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for people. Deforestation contributes to global warming due to excess carbon dioxide.My cause for creating this website is to bring awareness to the impact deforestation has on animals and the world. I care about this cause greatly because deforestation has impacted animals greatly due to it being a home to some and because some people donâ€™t know about what deforestation is doing and  the impact it has.</p>
